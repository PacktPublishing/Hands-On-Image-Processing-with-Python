This is the code repository for [Hands-On Image Processing with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/product/hands-on-image-processing-with-python/9781789343731), published by Packt.

**Expert techniques for advanced image analysis and effective interpretation of image data**

## What is this book about?
Image processing plays an important role in our daily lives with various applications such as in social media (face detection), medical imaging (X-ray, CT-scan), security (fingerprint recognition) to robotics &amp; space. This book will touch the core of image processing, from concepts to code using Python.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Perform basic data pre-processing tasks such as image denoising and spatial filtering in Python 
* Implement Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Frequency domain filters (e.g., Weiner) in Python 
* Do morphological image processing and segment images with different algorithms 
* Learn techniques to extract features from images and match images 
* Write Python code to implement supervised / unsupervised machine learning algorithms for image processing 
* Use deep learning models for image classification, segmentation, object detection, transfer learning and neural style transfer

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
viewer = viewer.ImageViewer(im)
viewer.show()
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for Computer Vision Engineers, and machine learning developers who are good with Python programming and want to explore details and complexities of image processing. No prior knowledge of the image processing techniques is expected.
